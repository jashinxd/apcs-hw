Comments are very descriptive, I am able to understand most of what is going on.


Zombie.java:
line@7-8 Not really sure what r and er are
line@57 Speed of charger seems to be too high, maybe make it a bit slower.
line@113-114 Instead of making them home in on the player, maybe make them move randomly until the player is near? Just my opinion

GamePanel.java:
line@343 and 369 - Seems to be two draw weapons, specify that you are drawing the name of the weapon
